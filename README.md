# Concurrency Course Repository

## Overview

Welcome to the Concurrency course repository from the University of Utrecht, completed during the Erasmus program. This repository contains individuals and group work for the assignments of the course.

## Assignments

The repository is organized into 3 assignments, each located in its own folder. Here's a brief overview of each assignment:

1. **Assignment 1: IBAN-Calculator**
    - Description: The purpose of the assignment is to write a program that returns information on the bank account numbers which the organisation manages. Because the range of bank account numbers is very large, your program must use multiple threads at the same time.
    - Folder: [IBAN-Calculator](https://github.com/uu-b3cc/iban-MarognaLorenzo)
    - Modality: Individual work
    - Language: Haskell
    - Topics: Task parallelism, dynamic work balancing, locks, thread management.
3. **Assignment 2: Delta-stepping SSSH**
    - Description: The aim is to implement a parallelizable version of Dijkstra algorithms for solving the problem of a single source shortest path (SSSH) in a graph.
    - Folder: [Delta-Stepping](https://github.com/uu-b3cc/delta-stepping-lorenzo-luka)
    - Modality: Group Work with [LuukBerkers](https://github.com/LuukBerkers)
    - Language: Haskell
    - Topics: Task Parallelism, STM, SSSH
4. **Assignment 3: Quickhull**
    - Description: The objective of this assignment is to design and implement a data-parallel version of Quickhull,
an algorithm to compute the smallest convex polygon containing a given set of points.
    - Folder: [Quickhull](https://github.com/uu-b3cc/quickhull-lorenzo-luka-1)
    - Modality: Group Work with [LuukBerkers](https://github.com/LuukBerkers)
    - Language: Haskell, Accelerate (Haskell framework for data parallelism)
    - Topics: Data Parallelism, GPU programming
